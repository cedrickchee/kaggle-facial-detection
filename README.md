# Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection Challenge

## Introduction

### Singapore Kaggle Machine Challenge Meetup Group

The [Singapore Kaggle Machine Learning Challenge Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Kaggle-Machine-Learning-Challenge) organized the [first Kaggle meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Kaggle-Machine-Learning-Challenge/events/245657152/) in Singapore on Jan 9 2018.

In this meeting, attendees formed teams with like-minded data scientists on Kaggle challenges of interest. In the following six weeks, the team will discuss the challenge, form a strategy and implement it. The outcome would then be presented to the audience at the Data Science Evening (our second meeting).

### Our Team

We are Team 12 (BestFitting). Our team consists of:
- Puay Ni Yi (leader)
- Teh Guo Pei
- Cedric Chee

We are tackling the [facial keypoints detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection) as our first Kaggle challenge.

### Project

This is a 6-weeks project.

#### Plan

We will use this repo as the central location to host all the tutorials and solutions for the challenge.

## The Challenge

Facial Keypoints Detection is a challenge focused on Computer Vision field. The techniques to solve this challenge is usually from Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

### Overview

The objective of this task is to detect and predict keypoint positions (locations) on face images. To learn more, take a look [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection).

## Tutorial

### Deep Learning Tutorial

We are basing our tutorial from [Daniel Nouri's blog post](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection#deep-learning-tutorial).

As we are planning to use TensorFlow for implementing our solution, we will follow this [tutorial by Alex Staravoitau](https://navoshta.com/facial-with-tensorflow/). Alex's tutorial was based on the amazing tutorial by Daniel Nouri.

## Solution

TBD
